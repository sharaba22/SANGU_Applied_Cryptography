4. Confidentiality: TLS uses symmetric encryption (like AES) to ensure that data is encrypted during transmission.
   Only the sender and receiver can decrypt it, preventing eavesdropping.

   Integrity: TLS uses message authentication codes (MACs) or ciphers like AES-GCM to
   detect if data has been tampered with during transmission.
