Signature Verification Explanation

When Alice signed the message using her private key, a digital signature was generated and attached to the encrypted file.
When Bob received the message and decrypted it using Alice’s public key to verify the signature.
Since the signature is verified using Alice’s public key and the output said "Good signature from Alice alice@sharabidze.com",
Bob can trust the message is from Alice and hasn’t been altered.
