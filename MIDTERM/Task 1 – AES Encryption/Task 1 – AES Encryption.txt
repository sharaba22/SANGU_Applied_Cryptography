For these tasks I used Win64 OpenSSL Command Prompt OpenSSL 3.5.1 

Task 1A: Encrypt a file using AES-128-CBC

1. Create a text file: secret.txt with the line: This file contains top secret information.

Command:
echo "This file contains top secret information." > secret.txt

Terminal output: None
This command on the local storage creates a file with the name: secret.txt and with content: This file contains top secret information.


2. Use OpenSSL to encrypt it with a passphrase of your choice.
3. Save the encrypted file as secret.enc.

Command:
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -salt -pbkdf2 -iter 100000 -in secret.txt -out secret.enc -pass pass:sharabidze

Terminal output: None
This command on the local storage creates a file with the name: secret.enc.
-aes-128-cbc: selects the cipher.
-salt: adds random salt for stronger encryption.
-pbkdf2: Enables the modern key derivation method.
-iter 100000: Specifies the number of iterations (the higher, the better security, but slower).
-in: is the input file.
-out: is the output encrypted file.
-pass pass:mysecretpass: provides the password directly.


Task 1B: Decrypt secret.enc

1. Decrypt the file.

Command:
openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 100000 -in secret.enc -out decrypted.txt -pass pass:sharabidze

Terminal output: None
This command on the local storage creates a file with the name: decrypted.txt and with content: This file contains top secret information.


2. Show that it matches the original.

Command:
type decrypted.txt

Terminal output: "This file contains top secret information."
