TLS Handshake Explanation

The TLS handshake is a process that initiates a secure communication channel 
between the client and server. It includes steps like negotiating the protocol version, 
selecting the cipher suite, authenticating the server via its digital certificate, and 
establishing session keys using public-key cryptography. Once the handshake is complete, 
encrypted communication begins using symmetric encryption.


MITM Protection Mechanisms

TLS protects against Man-in-the-Middle attacks primarily through:
Certificate validation: The server sends a digital certificate signed by 
a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The browser verifies this against its trusted root CA list.

Public-key encryption: Session keys are exchanged securely using asymmetric encryption, 
making it difficult for attackers to intercept or alter the exchange.

Integrity checks: TLS uses MAC (Message Authentication Code) to ensure 
messages are not altered in transit.


TLS Application in Websites

TLS is used in HTTPS to secure all data exchanged between the browser and server. 
It encrypts data such as login credentials, payment information, and personal details, 
protecting them from eavesdropping or tampering. TLS also authenticates the server to 
the client, ensuring users connect to the intended website and not an impostor.
