RSA is an asymmetric encryption method that uses a key pair (public/private). 
It is mainly used for secure key exchange, digital signatures, 
or small data encryption. RSA is slower and computationally expensive, 
especially with large files. Therefore, it's not ideal for encrypting large data.

AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm using the same key for encryption and decryption. 
It is fast, efficient, and widely used for bulk data encryption. AES-256 provides strong 
security and performance, making it suitable for encrypting files, disks, and communications.

In real-world systems, RSA often encrypts the AES key (used for bulk encryption), 
combining both algorithms in a hybrid model for secure and fast communication.
